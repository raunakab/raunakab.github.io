# My Personal Website
I will use this site to host multiple of my own writings, whether those writings be regarding technical software projects/endeavours of mine or just my own casual ramblings.

I will primarily write in regards to 3 different topics:
    - my work experience
    - my projects
    - blogs (technical articles, short stories, or just my own life)
