## Hey, I'm Raunak.

I'm a software engineer based out of San Francisco, CA.

I graduated from [UBC, Vancouver](https://www.ubc.ca) in May 2023.
I received a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Mathematics.

Upon graduation, I joined [Tesla](https://tesla.com) as a software engineer on their simulations team.
I was the one who brought up the [Cybertruck's](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck) [Steer-by-Wire](https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/cybertruck/en_us/GUID-46420EE2-F6B0-4E95-88D5-E50CB3061101.html) system into our simulation environment prior to its release in Nov. 2023.

I then got affected by mass lay-offs in Apr. 2024 and went about exploring California for a bit.

Now I'm working at [Eventual Computing](https://www.eventualcomputing.com), a small startup focusing on creating a distributed compute platform and tooling for the upcoming data age.

## Stuff I can do:
1. *distributed systems*:
I'm currently working on [daft](https://github.com/Eventual-Inc/Daft) at Eventual.
I implemented functionality to efficiently compute the approximate number of distinct elements in a *distributed* database using the [hyperloglog algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog).
You can check out all of my commits [here](https://github.com/Eventual-Inc/Daft/pull/2718).

1. *build systems*:
While at Tesla, I worked on bringing up new vehicle components using [buck2](https://buck2.build).
I wrote build targets and rules to implement a multi-stage build pipeline (including intermediary steps such as codegens).

1. *frontend*:
This blog is built using [nextjs](https://nextjs.org) and [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com).
It works and looks nice.

1. *languages*:
I have 2 years of professional experience with rust and python (Tesla + Eventual).
I have some experience writing firmware in C at Tesla.
I also work with gleam and golang in my freetime.
I favour languages with an algebraic type system.
