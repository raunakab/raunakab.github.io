# Prelude

I want to start getting into graphics + 2d rendering + UI design.
My current setup, a stock 2020 MacBook Pro 13" with 16gb of RAM, an Intel Chip, and an integrated GPU, won't fit the bill.
Everytime I try WebGPU rendering on this poor machine, it starts overheating like crazy.
I need something more powerful.

At first, I was thinking of just buying a Mac Mini, but... I don't know, that seems too simple of a task to me.
I want to challenge myself a little bit and buy something that I have to physically assemble.
Building a PC is the natural solution.

I guess this is my transition into a full-time enthusiast.
Steve Jobs would hate me.

# Research

First things first, I'll need to start doing a lot of research into this topic.
Computer parts can get expensive and I want to minimize any time and money wasted.

I already know for what purpose I want this computer.
Graphics + rendering.
I also know another thing that I am dead-set on.
Absolutey no Windows.
I would rather use any random, infected, buggy OS developed in Python than that piece of garbage.

So the next questions to answer would be things like:
- What do I need to buy?
- Where can I buy it?
- Is the price that I'm buying for a good price?
- Or am I being scammed?

Thankfully, we live in a day and age where we have access to unfathomable amounts of information at the tips of our fingers.
I also have a whole bunch of nerdy gamer friends who've already built their own PCs.
Although I am not looking to game (I have no interest), I will definitely seek their advice.

# Final Note

As I build this PC, I'm going to be posting about it on this blog.
Please don't take these series of articles as advice or some form of tutorial.
I'm just learning.
