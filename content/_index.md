My name's Raunak.
I'm a software engineer located in Palo Alto, CA.

I graduated from the [University of British Columbia, Vancouver](https://www.ubc.ca) in May 2023.
I received a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Mathematics.

My non-technical interests include:
- basketball
- hockey
- working out
- reading (mainly big-name fantasy fiction titles; e.g., LOTR, Harry Potter, Dune, etc.)
- watching tv shows + movies (currently watching [Ozark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozark_(TV_series)))

My technical interests include:
- build tools (highly invested in [`buck2`](https://buck2.build) right now)
- programming languages (`rust`, `ocaml`, `go`; in that order)
- web-based rendering engines
  - e.g., binaries compiled to [`WASM`](https://webassembly.org) with [`WebGPU`](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu) integrations
  - one can then deliver these `WASM` binaries to the client and run it in a some standardized `WASM-VM`
  - this can then render the entire "native-feeling" application to the client's screen
  - (note that there are security concerns with running arbitrary binaries client-side; this can be safe-guarded against by limiting the ABIs/APIs/symbols that that binary has access to in the first place)
