### About
As the world of green energy becomes more prominent, more and more individuals are purchasing solar panels.
However, when batteries fill up, the panels are rendered obsolete as the energy they absorb is no longer usefully stored.
Hygge provides a unique solution to this problem: using underlying infrastructure, you can trade packets of energy on the free market to others who want it.
The energy transactions are then recorded using a blockchain ledger.

### What I did
- Developed python scripts for pulling data from a GCP database to enter into another database hosted in India
- Developed a client-support web-application (written in `angular.js`) for employees to easily observe and resolve

### What I learned
- Scripting and batch data transferring
- How to develop applications in `angular.js`
    - Structure of an `angular` project
    - Data management in `angular`

### Technologies that I used
- `python`
- `angular.js`
- GCP (Google Cloud Platform)

### Closing Remarks
Thanks, Hygge, for a great 4 months!
