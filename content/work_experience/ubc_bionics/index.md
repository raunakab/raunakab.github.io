### About
Ontraccr is a startup based in Vancouver, British Columbia which provides an easy-to-use time-management application for construction companies.
The construction industry is a space in which the power and ease of technology is not quite present.
Many companies in this field stick to outdated methodologies for managing projects, and these outdated behaviours have significant negative impacts on their efficiencies.
This is where Ontraccr comes in; it's a web-application + mobile-application architecture in which managers can more easily communicate with their on-premise workers, assign tasks, and manage productivity.

### What I did
- Implemented feature to recursively move and archive folders/files in the in-app file-system
- Implementing a "divisions" feature to restrict access to folders based off user's position in company
- Performing integration of Typescript into existing Javascript backend codebase to increase code maintainability and allow for warnings/errors to be caught during compile-time rather than runtime
- Introduced linters and coding-style configuration files (ESLint + Prettier) to force an agreed-upon style on the backend codebase for cleaner code maintainability + readability
