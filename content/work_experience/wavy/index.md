### Prelude
*Wavy* is a startup that my partner and I cofounded in 2021.
As the currently acting CTO at *Wavy*, I'm developing the entire application-stack for our business.
This is, as need not be said, a difficult endeavour; producing a full-stack application is no light work.

However, an important part of the development lifecycle is not the destination, but rather the journey one embarks on.
As I continue to develop the software for my startup, I continually develop *myself* tenfold.

As a result, I have recently started documenting my experiences, ranging from the technical skills of lifting a startup to production, as well as the soft skills of managing one's mental health while doing so.

You can read more about it [here](/work_experience).
