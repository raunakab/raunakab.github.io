SDK Testing and Internal Applications Development in Java.

<!-- more -->

### About
Of course, Samsung needs no introduction.
Their products are internationally known and used.

The specific product that I worked on was *Samsung Knox*, a "cutting-edge security platform for mobile experience embedded in your Samsung Galaxy device".
In essence, Samsung chipsets contain additional circuitry to provide tighter data security and integrity.
As a result, developers may also obtain (premium) access to a proprietary SDK to help them interact with this chipset and develop applications utilizing it.

### What I did
- Developed internal applications to test the Samsung Knox SDK
    - Implemented features such as restriciting applications, all the way to geotracking a person's phone and turning off, for example, cellular data when within a 5km radius of a location
- Worked with external businesses and partners to resolve their issues and expedite their development process using the Knox SDK
- During my internship, another Knox team needed help with the release of the *Knox Parter Program*
    - Helped that team in the testing of their website and platform
    - Performed UX testing to spot places where users may have a difficult experience interacting with the product
    - Performed UI testing to spot design elements which were broken or not that well designed

### What I learned
- Team-wide `git` usage (as opposed to `git` used in an academic setting)
- Android application development
    - Application build processes
    - How screens are built
    - How to switch between screens

### Technologies that I worked with
- Java
- Gradle
- git / GitHub (Enterprise)

### Closing Remarks
Coming into this position, I had had no industry experience as of yet.
I experienced my first rampup, my first team meeting, my confusing bug, and endless design reviews with my coworkers.

And as I mature and continue growing as a SWE, I will always look back to this experience and marvel at how far I've come and what I'm capable of doing.
To a new engineer, the world is teeming full of questions and thoughts; Samsung will always be my first stepping-stone to understanding all of the chaos around me.

I've also made some wonderful friends there, some of whom I've developed a close friendship with and continue to talk to daily, even 2 years later!

Thanks to the amazing Samsung Knox team @ Vancouver for a wonderful 8 months!
