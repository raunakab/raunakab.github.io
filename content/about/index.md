### Education and Work Experience
I am a Combined Major in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of British Columbia.
I am a former Embedded Software Engineering Lead at UBC Bionics, a student design team situated at UBC.

I have worked as a software engineer at companies ranging in sizes: from corporates such as **Samsung** to startups such as **Ontraccr**.
My expertise is in full-stack engineering, with a slight preference for backend and UI.

My venture for experience led me to found my own startup: **Wavy**.
I have grown the most as a SWE there.
You can read more about it in my projects section.

### Interests
Overall, I'm a very active person (or at least try to be).
Considering the line of work that I'm in (i.e., sitting in front of a computer for hours on end), an otherwise active lifestyle is almost a necessity to counteract the effects of sitting still and typing.

I, to some degree, am a gym rat.
I work out for 1.5 hours a day (of which my latest sessions have started to include a moderate dose of cardio) for at least 5 days a week.

I also love playing basketball.
I grew up playing the sport as it was the one sport which was cheap and contained enough ethnic minorities for me to not stick out too much in.
As a result, I grew up surrounded by basketball culture: the fashion, the players, the hustle.
And although I am by no means a sneakerhead, I can appreciate a good pair of kicks once in a while.

I enjoy music and movies, the latter of which I love to informally review with my friends.
My favourite genre is indie.
I am always open to more suggestions.

### My Life
I was born in Mumbai, India on May 16, 1999.
I immigrated to Canada with my mom (1 year after my dad) in 2004 when I was 4 years old.
As any immigrant family, we tended to move around quite a bit; we lived in Toronto and Edmonton for a brief while before settling down in Calgary.

My childhood was eventful; although my family was not rich, I was able to enjoy things that any child would love to experience.

I played street hockey until the street lights were the only sources illuminating the corners of the roads.
I ate lots and lots of chocolate in front of the TV until my parents found me passed out the next morning (I have a remarkable sweet tooth).
I played hockey and basketball religiously, the latter of which I continued to play throughout high school and university, and still continue to play to this day.

My dad passed away when I was 12 years old.
My engineering and mathematical spirit can be largely attested to him.
His passion to his craft was simply admirable.

I also have a younger brother who was born in Edmonton while my family lived there.

My younger brother is diagnosed with high-needs Autism.
He is the reason why I do everything I do.
