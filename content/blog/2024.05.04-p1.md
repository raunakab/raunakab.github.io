# Intro

Frontend rendering is a segmented field.

To be fair, there are millions of tools and frameworks out there, but a large majority of them are *non-cross-platform*.
The rendering logic for an application written in Swift for iOS *cannot* be ported over to generate an Android application.
You will need to re-write your rendering logic for your Android application in Java/Kotlin.
This creates a duplication of logic written in two separate languages managed by, presumably, two separate teams.

There do exist some tools out there that bridge this gap, the most notable being [React Native](https://reactnative.dev).
React Native is a phenomenal tool and, especially aided by [Expo](https://expo.dev), it opens up quick and fast iteration by small teams to produce a *native* application available for both platforms *without* having two separate codebases.
This makes React Native especially appealing to startups; in fact, check out any startup's job listings and (if they're producing a native application), you will most likely see a listing for a React Native developer.

Another *more* notable cross-platform solution does exist, however.
The world-wide-web.
HTML sent across the wire to a client and rendered in a browser-engine is essentially cross-platform.
The browser-engine could be Safari running on a Mac or iPhone, or Mozilla Firefox running on a Linux PC, or Edge running on a Windows.
HTML can be written once and be rendered on virtually any device that has a browser[^1].

We can take the idea of the "unified, cross-platform" solution that browser rendering engines are and, alongside [WASM](https://webassembly.org) and [WebGPU](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu), we can create something potentially really cool.

This isn't strictly true.
It is possible to use *certain* HTML tags which are [not fully supported across all browsers and across all platforms and across all versions](https://caniuse.com).
This does mean that HTML is technically not fully cross-platform, *but given that most are supported in modern versions of modern browsers, it's cross-platform enough for the sake of this blog*.
