The journey of my startup, *Wavy*, from its initial stages to its current stature.

<!-- more -->

### Prelude
The world of startups is interesting.
One may encounter a tight-knit group of engineers and artists working harmoniously to produce the world's next hottest technology.
Or one may find a steaming pile of garbage.

I can definitively say that I have experienced both.
Whether that is a positive or a negative is a question I am still grappling with today.
Regardless, in all accounts, I have been able to learn skills which I would have otherwise never learned.

I am grateful for what I experienced.
Without it, I would not have been able to hold my own in my current venture.

### The Early Stages
As fitting as it sounds, *Wavy* was founded in my mom's basement.
A sweltering heatwave drove me down there, as it did to many others in the summer of 2021 in Calgary, Alberta.

My current business partner arranged a meeting with myself and 2 others to discuss an idea which he had been mulling over in his mind for a while.
This idea, however, was ***far*** from what *Wavy* would one day materialize into, as is the case for many startups at this early stage of ideation.
Unfortunately, the exact details as to what the original idea was seem to escape me at the current moment.

Truthfully speaking, the other 2 invitees and I were not very intrigued by the proposed idea, but the fear of missing out enticed us enough to stick around for a couple more meetings.
And it was during the course of these subsequent calls that the current-day *Wavy* started finally taking form: a UBC exlcusive application geared towards helping connect clubs and organizations to the vast amount of students on campus, as well as providing a medium for students to meet each other.

The idea seemed plausible for our team and (arguably more importantly) attractive to a larger audience.
And so our small group of 4 began development.

However, as the codebase grew and our idea started settling into its niche marketplace, life started catching up with 2 of our members.
Due to extraneous reasons of which I will lay no mention in this article, they were unable to continue forth in development, and thus departed from the team.
This left myself and my partner stranded with an incomplete codebase and an overambitious deadline for release.

More pressingly, my partner was non-technical.
I was left at the helm of the ship, steering alone.

A more seasoned developer would have no fret; full-stack engineering is a topic which has an unimaginable wealth of online resources available, and experience is the name of the game.
I, however, was by no means considered seasoned.
I would have hardly even called myself sufficient.

But a quite interesting feature of my personality is my need to prove people wrong.
And, boy, was this a perfect opportunity.

So I gripped the steering wheel tighter and metalled the pedal (or however that saying goes).

### Current Stage
Fast-forward to the current day, and it has been around 8 months since *Wavy*'s original ideation.
And although the platform is still under major development, I have more or less adapted to the role of steering this ship.

As I continue to refine my skills and chip away at the software engineering feat of releasing a product, I have noticed an interesting phenomena start to take place: I have started to gain confidence in my engineering decisions.

I can quantitatively write programs faster now.
I can efficiently reason about the benefits and pitfalls of an implementation to a reasonable degree *just off the top of my head*.
Yes, I do occassionaly make mistakes, and no, I am nowhere close to knowing all there is about the various implementations and optimizations that exist, but I have no doubt a vastly more rich understanding of how software is orchestrated and released.

Furthermore, our team has expanded to include one additional member who's currently working on the frontend development alongisde myself.
His addition to our team has considerably lightened my load and stress.
He is also astoundingly talented at frontend design.

Despite the situation in the prior section seeming grim, our team has successfully overcome those hurdles.
We are now slated for a release this upcoming summer.
And we are now more optimistic in our future than ever.

### Closing Remarks
As we gear up for our first public release, I think it would be wise for me to document my decision choices and any difficulties encountered.
This can simultaneously function as a wonderful mechanism for tracking my progress as a SWE, as well as a subtle way to show off my skills.

As such, I will write and release articles pertaining to the entire technical stack being developed at *Wavy*.
Hopefully readers will be able to gain insight into the functionings of a full-stack application.

And I hope you, reader, have been successfully captured by the story of *Wavy*.
And given the fact that you have read until here, I have a feeling that maybe you did.
