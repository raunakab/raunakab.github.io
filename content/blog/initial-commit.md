Hello, again, world.

<!-- more -->

### Hello World
Firstly, my motivation for starting a blog would be fitting.

A few of my classmates and many of my professors each maintain their own blogs.
Their own personal reasons obviously elude me, but guessing at the obvious: penning down your ideas is a great form of advertisement of your expertise and skill (especially useful for technical people).

Another subtle, yet important, reason would be to do it just for the practice.
The more you write, the easier it becomes to formulate thoughts and expressions.
Communication is an important necessity in any field; what good is a good idea if you can't convince others that it's a good idea?

### Thematics
Thematically, out of the blog posts I have run across, some discuss serious and technical topics only, while others strike a balance between personal stories and technical articles.
As for myself, I wish to aim for the latter; I want to be able to discuss technical topics, as this will be, in large parts, a technical blog, but I also wish to discuss lighter topics, such as my personal habits, day-to-day happenings, etc.

### Goals
Clarity and smoothness in transitioning between thoughts is my primary goal.
Namely, I want to be able to segue into different topics in a way which is elegant to the reader; concluding the previous thought while setting the stage for the next.
I do, however, realize that this is a non-measurable goal (or may be measurable, but a pragmatic tool which can quantitatively analyze language sentiment and structure is not yet something which exists with today's technology -- yes, I know NLP tools exist, but they're not solving *this* exact problem).

### Frequency
As previously mentioned, writing is a skill which is perfected through practice (as are quite many skills in the world).
I will try to write at least one blog once a week, however mundane and unrelatable as it may be.
I can make no promises one each post's length, but I will try to keep the quality consistent (to whatever measure of consistency that I choose, a criteria which is subject to my discretion... after all, this is *my* blog).

### Final Remarks
Thank you.
