Recently got laid off from Tesla.
Taking time to work on things that I find interesting.

Some of those things include:
- learning `go`, `ocaml`
- working more with `C`
- diving deeper in `linux`
- diving deeper into systems engineering
- learning about `buck2`, Meta's new open-source build system
- working on / learning frontend rendering using [`vello`](https://github.com/linebender/vello), which internally uses `WASM` and `WebGPU`
  - this space is especially exciting because, assuming that one can size-optimize a rendering engine, the world-wide-web can transition to "server-provided-rendering-engines" instead of relying upon the traditional "client-provided-rendering-engines"
  - that could completely change the way we browse the internet
  - i.e., think of browsing through the web using "native-feeling applications" instead of web pages

As always, will continue honing my skills in `rust`.

Location wise, I'm currently residing in Palo Alto, CA, but I'm also looking for new job opportunities.
In the case I find something remote, I may consider relocating to Seattle, Austin, NYC, or Miami.
